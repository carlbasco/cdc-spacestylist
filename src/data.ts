    bio: `My journey started in a Furniture Company 
    where I worked for a couple of years. That was
    my very first job as a graduate of Bachelor of 
    Fine Arts major in Advertising in University of 
    Santo Tomas. Not finding my first job very 
    challenging I joined a Modular Kitchen Company 
    & Landscaping firm, yet there was more to 
    fulfillment in this one and so I decided to 
    accept a job in a construction and interior 
    finishing material business company. This 
    is where I found my dream and heartâ€™s desire. 
    It gradually cultivated my interest and 
    passion. Working with them made me realize 
    that this is where I belong in designing 
    for the rest of my life. But there was a 
    set back. My duties as a full-time mom, 
    hardly left me ample time for my professional 
    growth. Yet it did not take a while. Home 
    conditions greatly eased and ushered in 
    comfortable time to reconnect with design, 
    the thing I love most to do. = then, 
    I worked on completing a Diploma in Interior 
    Design Institute. It has greatly equipped me 
    with more knowledge enhanced my creativity and 
    build my confidence to face the challenges of 
    an even-changing trend in interior design.
